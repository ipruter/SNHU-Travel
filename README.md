# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories: help with this?

# Holding an in-person meeting with the client is important to understanding what they are looking for in their product. This allows you to directly get any clarification about user needs you may have questions about. User stories are a great way to document the needs. The story establishes a need the product feature will need to address It also establishes a very rough estimate of time and resources needed to create the feature. They essentially bridge the need of the user to the solution from the developer. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

# I personally love the concept of the backlog, stories, and product iterations. Going forward, I plan on isolating the individual needs into features. This is opposed to my usual approach of jumping into the project with a general idea what the program will do. Iterating is something Iâ€™m normally good about doing. Even with small projects I make a very simple but error free feature. I then develop aesthetics and add features after everything is tested. Prioritizing the needs in a backlog is something I will also do going forwards. This allows the team, or myself, to manage time and resources efficiently.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

# Being a good team member comes down to being productive and communicating frequently, in my opinion. Being a good worker is obvious but working as a team member ensures your work best integrates with the product. Having a broader understanding of the product being attentive to updates is a great way of achieving that. Being open to learning new things or sharing your niche expertise with others lacking in that area is another way to be a valuable team member.
